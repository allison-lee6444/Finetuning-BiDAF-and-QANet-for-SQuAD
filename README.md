# BIDAF-QANet-Optimization-on-SQuAD
We hope to finetune BIDAF and QANet to achieve a better result in the SQuAD dataset. We will be evaluating our results in terms of the F1 score (precision and recall of the words chosen that is a part of the answer) and the EM score (number of exactly correct answers).
