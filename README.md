# Finetuning BiDAF and QANet for SQuAD 
Our goal was to come up with an architecture with the highest EM and F1 score on the SQuAD Question and Answer dataset. We eventually came up with a BiDAF model scoring 56.5468 on EM and 68.57654 on F1 and a QANet model scoring 34.9763 on EM and 46.45 on F1.

Please see 2. BiDAF.ipynb and 3. QANet.ipynb for the detailed description of our experiments as well as the final results.
